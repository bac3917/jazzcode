### Purpose of code: this code takes a list of jazz musicians and scrapes biographical information from Wikipedia about 
### each musician and places it into a dataframe
### Later will MERGE other jazz data to this dataframe using musician first/last name

### Known issues: some musicians are not listed on Wikipedia, and some musicians will not have information 
### in the Wikipedia class named "table.infobox.vcard.plainlist"

### Possible approaches:  
###         1. scrape specific data elements from the infobox, such as name and instruments  or  
###         2. grab all infobox data and parse it subsequently (this approach is shown below)
###

library(rvest);library(stringr)
jazzlist<-c("Art Pepper","Horace Silver","Art Blakey","Philly Joe Jones", "Miles Davis","Thelonius Monk", "John Coltrane","Max Roach")
target_pages = paste0('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search/', gsub(" ", "_", jazzlist))

# grab all text from Wikipedia infobox
data=data.frame()
for (url in target_pages){
        webpage = read_html(url)
        # do whatever else you want here with rvest functions 
        info<-webpage %>% html_nodes(xpath='//*[contains(concat( " ", @class, " " ), concat( " ", "plainlist", " " ))]') %>%
                html_text() 
        temp<-data.frame(info, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
        data = rbind(data,temp) #combines each result/page into a df
}

# note: curent code creates extra rows with useless information

# cleaning steps
library(data.table);library(stringr);library(dplyr)


# parsing 
data$name<-str_extract(data4..........????
data$birthyear<-str_extract(data4..........????
data$deathyear<-str_extract(data4..........????
data$label<-str_extract(data4..........????
